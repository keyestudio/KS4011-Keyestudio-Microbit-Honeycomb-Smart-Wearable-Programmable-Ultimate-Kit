# 3.Introduction

**( 1 )What is Micro:bit?**

Designed by BBC, Micro:bit main board aims to help children aged above 10 years
old to have a better learning of programming.

It is equipped with loads of components,including a 5\*5 LED dot matrix, 2
programmable buttons, a compass, a Micro USB interface and a Bluetooth module
and others. Though it is just the size of a credit card, it boasts multiple
functions. To name just a few, it can be applied in programming video games,
making interactions between light and sound, controlling a robot, conducting
scientific experiments, developing wearable devices and make some cool
inventions like robots and musical instruments, basically everything imaginable.

This new version, that’s the version 2.0, of Micro:bit main board has a
touch-sensitive logo and a MEMS microphone. And there is a buzzer built in the
other side of the board which makes playing all kinds of sound possible without
any external equipment. The golden fingers and gears added provide a better
fixing of crocodile clips. Moreover, this board has a sleeping mode to lower the
power consumption of battery and it can be entered if users long press the Reset
& Power button on the back of it. More importantly, the CPU capacity of this
version is much better than that of the V1.5 and the V2 has more RMA.

In final analysis, the Micro:bit main board V2 can allow customers to explore
more functions so as to make more innovative products.

**( 2 ) Comparison between V2.0 & V1.5**

For the Micro: Bit main board V2, pressing the Reset & Power button , it will
reset the Micro: Bit and rerun the program.If you hold it tight, the red LED
will slowly get darker.When the power indicator flickers into darkness,
releasing the button and your Micro: Bit board will enter sleep mode for power
saving .This will make your battery more durable. And you could press this
button again to ‘wake up’ your Micro:bit.

**( 4 )Notes for the application of Micro:bit main board V2.0**

1.  It is recommended to cover it with a silicone protector to prevent short
    circuit for it has a lot of sophisticated electronic components.

2.  Its IO port is very weak in driving since it can merely handle current less
    than 300mA. Therefore, do not connect it with devices operating in large
    current,such as servo MG995 and DC motor or it will get burnt. Furthermore,
    you must figure out the current requirements of the devices before you use
    them and it is generally recommended to use the board together with a
    Micro:bit shield.

3.  It is recommended to power the main board via the USB interface or via the
    battery of 3V. The IO port of this board is 3V, so it does not support
    sensors of 5V. If you need to connect sensors of 5 V, a Micro: Bit expansion
    board is required.

d.When using pins(P3、P4、P6、P7、P10)shared with the LED dot matrix, blocking
them from the matrix or the LEDs may display randomly and the

data about sensors maybe wrong.

e.The battery port of 3V cannot be connected with battery more than 3.3V or the
main board will be damaged.

f. Forbid to use it on metal products to avoid short circuit.

To put it simple, Micro:bit V2 main board is like a micro computer which has
made programming at our fingertips and enhanced digital innovation. And about
programming environment, BBC provides a website: <https://microbit.org/code/,>
which has a graphical MakeCode program easy for use.

**4.Install Micro:bit Driver**

If you have downloaded micro:bit driver, then no need to download it again.

If it is you first time to use micro:bit main board, then you will have to
download the driver.

First of all, connect the micro:bit to your computer using a USB cable.

And enter the link https://fs.keyestudio.com/KS4011

to download the driver file of micro:bit,
![](media/6a743ae7e5d2d20755616236e3be275e.png).

# 5.Getting Started with Micro:bit

The following instructions are applied for Windows system but can also serve as
a reference if you are using a different system.

## 5.1 Write code and program

This chapter describes how to write program with the App Micro: Bit and load the
program to the Micro: Bit main board V2.

You are recommended to browse the official website of Micro:bit for more
details, and the link is attached below:

[https://microbit.org/guide/quick/](Https://microbit.org/guide/quick/)

**Step 1: connect the Micro: Bit main board V2 with your computer**

Firstly, link the Micro: Bit main board V2 with your computer via the USB
cable.Macs、PCs、 Chromebooks and Linux （including Raspberry Pi）systems are
all compatible with the Micro: Bit main board V2.

Note that if you are about to pair the board with your phone or tablet, please
refer to this link:

<https://microbit.org/get-started/user-guide/mobile/>

![](media/f00f946e1f194811b1c84725e0eb5d16.png)
![](media/f44b10aa08f2d5862499e7efed84e040.png)

Secondly, if the red LED on the back of the board is on, that means the board is
powered. Then Micro: Bit main board V2 will appear on your computer as a driver
named 'MICROBIT(E)'. Please note that it is not an ordinary USB disk as shown
below.

![](media/a2b53f93f4c24b81fc5cdb5986fd100d.png)

**Step 2: write programs**

View the link https://makecode.microbit.org/ in your browser;

Click ‘New Project’;

The dialog box‘Create a Project’ appears, fill it with ‘heartbeat’ and click
‘Create √’to edit.

(If you are running Windows 10 system, it is also viable to edit on the APP
MakeCode for micro:bit , which is exactly like editing in the website. And the
link to the APP is
https://www.microsoft.com/zh-cn/p/makecode-for-micro-bit/9pjc7sv48lcx?ocid=badgep&rtc=1&activetab=pivot:overviewtab
)

![](media/397bd09e4c2baf3c933857f3d0d1b83f.png)

![](media/5427d2c4fbb30ffdbce2fe9315244245.png)

Write a set of micro:bit code. You can drag some modules in the Blocks to the
editing area and then run your program in Simulator of MakeCode editor as shown
in the picture below which demonstrates how to edit ‘heartbeat’ program .

As for loading test code , please turn to Chapter 5.5.

And introduction of Makecode is on the next chapter 5.2.

![](media/a6aa8681158ce5b64ffba50c1238f8c8.png)

**Step 3: download test code**

If your computer is Windows 10 and you have downloaded the APP MakeCode for
micro:bit to write program, what you will have to do to download the program to
your Micro: Bit main board V2 is merely clicking the ‘Download’ button, then all
is done.

If you are writing programs through the website, following these steps:

Click the‘Download’ in the editor to download a "hex" file, which is a compact
program format that the Micro: Bit main board can read.Once the hexadecimal file
is downloaded, copy it to your board V2 just like the process that you copy the
file to the USB driver. If you are running Windows system, you can also
right-click and select ‘Send to → MICROBIT (E:) ‘to copy the hex file to the
Micro: Bit main board V2.

![](media/a81d4430eb152346d13bf67b2233b9db.png)

You can also directly drag the "hex" file onto the MICROBIT (E:) disk.

![](media/fe0f2de72ba0b38f00403f1aaef7f514.png)

![](media/b4f3602c0e192646f77b150e2acaf947.png)

During the process of copying the downloaded hex file to the Micro: Bit main
board V2, the yellow signal light on the back side of the board flashes. When
the copy is completed, the yellow signal light will stop flashing and remain on.

**Step 4: run the program**

After the program is uploaded to the Micro: Bit main board V2, you could still
power it via the USB cable or change to via an external power. The 5 x 5 LED dot
matrix on the board displays the heartbeat pattern.

![](media/672bfb4d87b938fc586a849bff0229fe.png)

Power via micro USB cable

![](media/d61a26d2f2367f0378974832f679efe1.png)

Power via external power（3V）

**Step 5：learn about other programming languages**

This chapter has described how to use the Micro: Bit main board V2.

But except for the Makecode graphical programming introduced you can also write
Micro: Bit programs in other languages. Go to the link:
<https://microbit.org/code/> to know about other programming languages , or view
the link: <https://microbit.org/projects/>, to find something you want to have a
go.

## 5.2 Makecode：

Browse <https://makecode.microbit.org/> and enter Makecode online editor or open
the APP MakeCode for micro:bit of Windows 10.

![](media/306e32b77a5dae6927b5dd0f6cf6f4f4.png)

Click“New Project”, and input“heartbeat”，then enter Makecode editor, as shown
below:

![](media/c5d52e632549cae8e23944f8febe5a03.png)

There are blocks“on start”and“forever”in the code editing area.

When the power is plugged or reset,“on start”means that the code in the block
only executes once, while“forever”implies that the code runs cyclically.

## 5.3.Quick Download

As mentioned before, if your computer is Windows 10 and you have downloaded the
APP MakeCode for micro:bit to write programs, the program written can be quickly
downloaded to the Micro: Bit main board V2 by selecting ‘Download’.

While it is a little more trickier if you are using a browser to enter makecode.
However, if you use Google Chrome, suitable for Linux，macOS and Windows 10, the
process can be quicker too.

We use the webUSB function of Chrome to allow the internet page to access the
hardware device connected USB.

You could refer to the following steps to connect and pair devices.

**Device pairing:**

![](media/c6f1815b59ee0ba347ba8ef851b34cf1.png)

## 5.5 Input test code

We provide hexadecimal code files (project files) for each project.The file
contains all the contents of the project and can be imported directly, or you
can manually drag the code blocks to complete the program for each project. For
simple projects, dragging a block of code to complete the program is
recommended. For complex projects, it is recommended to conduct the program by
importing the hexadecimal code file we provide.

Let's take the "Heatbeat" project as an example to show how to load the code.

Open the Web version of Makecode or the Windows 10 App version of
Makecode![](media/ebc8f179f28ab520bc63944361d64d64.png)

Click “Import File”;

![](media/3358909f898dd9898923f72945613851.png)

## Project 3: LED Dot Matrix

![](media/8c3f540a07aab97e1608ba8770837f7b.png)

**( 1 )Project Description:**

Dot matrices are very commonplace in daily life. They have found wide
applications in LED advertisement screens, elevator floor display, bus stop
announcement and so on.

The LED dot matrix of Micro: Bit main board V2 contains 25 LEDs in a grid.
Previously, we have succeeded in controlling a certain LED to light by
integrating its position value into the test code. Supported by the same theory,
we can turn on many LEDs at the same time to showcase patterns, digits and
characters.

What’s more, we can also click”show icon“ to choose the pattern we like to
display. Last but not the least, we can design our patterns by ourselves.

## Project 6: Geomagnetic Sensor

![](media/24c31bb0174e2ac672203e5c36c6875e.png)

**( 1 )Project Description:**

This project aims to explain the use of the Micro: bit geomagnetic sensor, which
can not only detect the strength of the geomagnetic field, but also be used as a
compass to find bearings. It is also an important part of the Attitude and
Heading Reference System (AHRS). Micro: Bit main board V2 uses LSM303AGR
geomagnetic sensor, and the dynamic range of magnetic field is ±50 gauss. In the
board, the magnetometer module is used in both magnetic detection and compass.
In this experiment, the compass will be introduced first, and then the original
data of the magnetometer will be checked.The main component of a common compass
is a magnetic needle, which can be rotated by the geomagnetic field and point
toward the geomagnetic North Pole (which is near the geographic South Pole) to
determine direction.

**( 2 )Components Needed:**

-   Micro:bit main board V2 \*1

-   Micro USB cable\*1

**( 3 )Test Code 1：**

Link computer with micro:bit board by micro USB cable, and program in MakeCode
editor.

**( 4 )Test Results 1：**

After uploading test code to micro:bit main board V2 and powering the board via
the USB cable, and pressing the button A, the board asks us to calibrate compass
and the LED dot matrix shows “TILT TO FILL SCREEN”. Then enter the calibration
page. Rotate the board until all 25 LEDs are on red as shown below.

![](media/acf3b8c0dee027d9e555fc708831f874.jpeg)

After that, a smile pattern
![](media/55ad39536dff7bdf66379a1da7a4c137.png) appears, which implies
the calibration is done. When the calibration process is completed, pressing the
button A will make the magnetometer reading display directly on the screen. And
the direction north, east, south and west correspond to 0°, 90°, 180° and 270°.

**( 5 ) Test Code 2：**

![](media/c5f5e2d243a04c4a4bd0ba289f1e023f.png)

This module can keep readings to determine direction, so does point to the
current magnetic North Pole by arrow.

are 6 sockets on it, 2 G, 2 V and 2 S, which are connected. Additionally, G is
GND, VV is VCC, and S is the signal end of the module.

Its function is to detect vibration and tilt. The SW-200D vibration switch
element adopted on this module is a ball type tilt induction unidirectional
trigger switch, one end of which is gold-plated(trigger end), another one is
silver-plated (conductive end).

When the module is in the horizontal position or inclined to the conductive end
(silver-plated), the switch element is in OFF state and the signal end outputs
the high level; when the module is tilted to the trigger terminal (gold-plated),
the switch element is ON state, and the signal terminal outputs the low level.
When the angle of the conductive end (silver-plated)is lower than 10 °
horizontally and the module is shaken by external force, so the trigger end
(gold-plated) will be in a short-time ON state, which makes the module detect
vibration.

## Project 24: Light Brightness

**Overview**

It is seen that sensors are everywhere in our daily life. Some public street
lights automatically light up during the day and automatically go out at night.
Why?In fact, those lights make use of a photosensitive element that can measure
the brightness of external light.In the evening, when outside brightness becomes
lower, the street light is automatically controlled to be turned on.

In this project, you will learn how to use our keyestudio photocell sensor and
micro:bit to control the brightness of external light. Show the result on 5\*5

The Keyestudio micro bit honeycomb photoresistor is fully compatible with micro
bit control boards. In the experiment, we connect it with the micro: bit by a
crocodile clip. There are 6 connectors which are G, G, V, V, S and S

Additionally, G is GND, V is VCC, and S is the signal end of the module.

The sensor also includes a photoresistor whose resistance varies with ambient
lightness. The brighter the ambient environment is, the higher the resistance
is. Otherwise, the lower the resistance is. During the test, we test the analog
value of S end via a micro: bit board. The brighter the ambient environment is,
the larger the analog value becomes; and the darker the light is, the smaller
the analog value is.

So now let's move to coding. Below are some steps to follow.

Open the
[https://makecode.micro:bit.org/\#editor](https://makecode.microbit.org/#editor)
to write your code.

Microsoft MakeCode is actually a platform that allows us to code for a
micro:bit, and also provides an interactive simulator where we can debug and run
our code, and will be able to see what to expect out right there on the site.

Go to MakeCode and choose **My Projects** and click on **New Projects**.

CoolTerm serial port monitor displays the light intensity analog values read by
the TEMT6000 ambient light sensor (P1) to render the buzzer to make a sound.If
the simulated values of ambient light and soil moisture are both less than or
equal to 100, the buzzer will not sound;If the simulated value of ambient light
is greater than 100 and the simulated value of soil moisture is less than or
equal to 100, the buzzer will play bass B;When the simulated value of ambient
light is less than or equal to 100, and the simulated value of soil moisture is
greater than 100, the buzzer will play tenor D;When the simulated value of
ambient light and the simulated value of soil moisture are both greater than
100, the buzzer utters the high tone E.
